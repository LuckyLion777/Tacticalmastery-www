                        Our bundle of 4 flashlights arrived in a heavy-duty case. We later learned that the case was modeled after the leading handgun case on the market. 
                        <br/>
                        Naturally we popped in some batteries as fast as we could and WOW! The brightness of the beam surpassed even our wildest expectations, it packed some serious punch. 
                        <br/>
                        Next, we toggled the “Strobe” and “SOS/Distress” modes. We were amazed at how the sophisticated features were so easy to use.
